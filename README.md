# ForemanThemify

*Introdction here*

This is a plugin that enables building a theme for Foreman.
It knows to inject its assets before the core ones, so
if it an asset with the same name exists both in core and
in the plugin - plugin's one will be used.
This concept allows us to replace images, javascript files and
css files completely.
